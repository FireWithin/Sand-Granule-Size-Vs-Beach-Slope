# Sand-Granule-Size-Vs-Beach-Slope
Using the technique of Linear Regression, slope of the beach for a given diameter of sand granule is predicted.

Attributes:
  Size of Sand Granule: Mean diameter of sand granules (in mm)

Prediction:
  The slope of the beach (in degrees)

Model: 
  Slope = theta_0 + theta_1*Size
  
Result:
  theta_0 = -2.3433
  theta_1 = 16.7717
